This program will display a 3D scene with three green spheres, X, Y, and Z, positioned at (-2.5,0,0), (0,2,0), and (0,-2,0), respectively. The scene will also display three red arrows, with the positions and axis calculated as the vector difference between the positions of the spheres. Finally, it will print the position of X.
