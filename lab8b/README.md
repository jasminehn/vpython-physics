This program is calculating the rest energy and the velocity of two particles, v_2 and v_alpha, using some constants. First, it defines some constants such as the speed of light in a vacuum 'c', the mass of one particle 'M_alpha', the mass of another particle 'M_other', and the original mass 'M_original'. Then it uses these constants to calculate the rest energy of the original particle 'E_rest_original' and the sum of rest energies of 'M_alpha' and 'M_other' particles. After that, it calculates the velocity of the two particles, v_2 and v_alpha, using the mass of the two particles and the constants defined earlier, and then it prints the calculated velocities. The end result is `1.4554e+5` and `8.38361e+6`.
